### d3panels: Basic D3-based graphic panels

[Karl W Broman](http://kbroman.org)

This is a set of basic [D3](http://d3js.org)-based graphic panels, to
be combined into larger multi-panel charts.

(I'm going to re-implement the panels in my
[R/qtlcharts](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) package and separate them
out as a separate repository.)

There are other libraries with similar goals that are of more general
use (e.g., [C3.js](http://c3js.org) and
[d3.Chart](http://misoproject.com/d3-chart/); see
[this list of javascript chart libraries](http://blog.webkid.io/javascript-chart-libraries/)),
but I wanted charts that were a bit _less_ general and flexible, but
rather more specific to my particular applications (and style).
